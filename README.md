# 🛍️ NovaShop

**NovaShop** is a modern e-commerce web app built with **React** and styled using **TailwindCSS**. It uses the [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com/) as a mock backend to simulate real-world e-commerce functionality. The project leverages **TanStack Query** for efficient data fetching and caching, and **React Context API** for global state management (e.g., the shopping cart).
